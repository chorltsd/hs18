** Don't fret, you can still sign up to [join a team.](https://hackseq.github.io/hs18/2018/03/15/participants.txt.html)

hackseq is a peer-led hackathon, which means *you* propose the projects. We'll help you recruit your team and get you the resources to turn your idea into a reality. This is a great oppertunity to collaborate and test out your ideas.

Teams are usually between 4-8 people and you'll have 72 hours to work together and get the idea off the ground. Successful projects have a clearly defined objective and managable scope.

If you've got any questions, shoot us an [email](mailto:hackseq@gmail.com).
