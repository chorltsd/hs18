**100% DIY:** Share an idea. Lead a team. Hack a solution together

## Team Leader Applications

<div></div>
## \~\~\~> Applications are now closed (June 21st) :'( <\~\~\~
<div></div>

** Don't fret, sign up for the [mailing list](https://www.hackseq.com/mail) and we'll let you know when the Participant Applications are open.

hackseq is a peer-led hackathon, which means *you* propose the projects. We'll help you recruit your team and get you the resources to turn your idea into a reality. This is a great oppertunity to collaborate and test out your ideas.

Teams are usually between 4-8 people and you'll have 72 hours to work together and get the idea off the ground. Successful projects have a clearly defined objective and managable scope.

If you've got any questions, shoot us an [email](mailto:hackseq@gmail.com).
