* [**Learn More about the hackseq18 Projects**](https://hackseq.github.io/hs18/2018/08/11/Projects2018.txt.html)

**hackseq** is a greatplace to meet like-minded individuals, learn and collaborate to create something big.

hackseq is a 100% DIY hackathon, which means your peers have proposed projects, you apply to join a team and then we all meet together for a 72 hour coding-fest to turn those projects into a reality.

Teams are usually between 4-8 people. Join a team where your strengths will shine or one that will challenge you to become a better scientist.
