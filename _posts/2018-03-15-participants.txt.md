A hackathon is a great place to meet like-minded individuals, learn, and collaborate to create something big.

## Participant Applications

* Calm down, Participant Applications haven't opened yet. *
* Get on the [mailing list](https://www.hackseq.com/mail) and we'll let you know when they are open (~End of July). *
